Machine Learning and Statistics Project 2020


In this project you must create a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions
based on the data set powerproduction available on Moodle. The goal is to
produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed
values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with
predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. Your submission
must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that trains a model using the data set. In the notebook you
should explain your model and give an analysis of its accuracy.
2. Python script that runs a web service based on the model, as above.
3. Dockerfile to build and run the web service in a container.
4. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.
To enhance your submission, you might consider developing and comparing more than
one model.
